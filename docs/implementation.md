<h2>Proactive Topology</h2>
<p> ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator. If, for example, an event scheduled for simulation time "100 seconds" is executed, and the next event is not scheduled until "200 seconds", the simulator will immediately jump from 100 seconds to 200 seconds (of simulation time) to execute the next event. This is what is meant by "discrete-event" simulator. </p>
