<h2>About</h2>
This project is an attempt to extend some SDN functionalities present in ns-3. We have done this as part of our Major Project in the final year of our undergraduate degree. If you are new to these jargons (SDN, ns-3), don't worry! We have made an exclusive section just for you :) 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the current implementation of OpenFlow in ns-3, a controller canâ€™t know the complete topology of a network before a node starts sending packets to another node, as shown in the below figure.

Our implementation focuses on resolving the above issue by bringing in proactive learning for the controller, as depicted in the figure below.

Also, currently ns-3 limits the use of a single switch per a controller. We have added the functionality to support multiple switches per a controller.
